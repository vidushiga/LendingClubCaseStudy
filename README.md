# Lending Club Case Study
Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return.
When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. The aim of this case study is to identify the driving factors behind loan default. The company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
